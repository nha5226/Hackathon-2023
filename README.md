## Cook the pain away!

We help people with chronic pain socializing and eating healthy by designing a AR cooking game where they can cook pain-reducing recipes together while staying at home. We want to make a recommentation system to recommend pain reliefing recipes based on what helped other people.

### What is the problem?
20% of the world's population suffers from chronic pain.
Until now, the main solution for coping with daily pain has been strong medication.
The shocking thing is that 10% of those affected abuse opioids.
We have found that the most important factors in relieving chronic pain are nutrition and social interaction.
Unfortunately, many people with chronic pain are unable to leave their homes.

### How do we solve this problem?
We present...COOK THE PAIN AWAY
A unique and innovative solution that brings together people with common diseases and a common interest in food.
People meet to cook together via Argumented Reality without having to leave their homes. In this way we combine the two factors of healthy eating and social interaction.

### Description of the application
We have two applications.
It starts with the mobile application where users can create an account and enter their food preferences, their disease and their pain area. They also have to enter the date and time they want to cook.
To match two users, we use a memory-based collaborative filtering system that uses user similarity to make recipe recommendations based on what both users like to eat.
Once we have matched two users, the users get the shopping list for the recipe that both users want to cook. Now they can enter their AR session on the scheduled date.

### This is where the fun begins!
In our second application, both users wear an AR headset and can start cooking. Through the AR headset, they see not only their cooking partner, but also the cooking instructions and, of course, their real kitchen. They can now talk to each other from the comfort of their own kitchen. They both appear as avatars that they can choose. This gives them a bit of anonymity, which is especially important for users who find it difficult to talk about their health conditions and perhaps even drug addiction.

### Technologies for this application are:

Mobile application with React Native,
REST API with Express using TypeScript,
3D Models with Blender,
Augmented Reality application with Unreal Engine,
Postgres Database
Machine Learning in Python using Pandas and scikit-learn
Future plans for the project:
The application would only work with enough users for matching and a working and improving machine learning model.
So the question is: How can we get the attention of the target audience?
One approach would be to partner with health organisations and government health associations.
In terms of scalability, one idea is to match people based on their pain, age, gender or other personal interests with a separate recommendation system.
